# gpt-Molly
gpt-MollyDescriptionMolly is an advanced AI security assistant that integrates GPT-4 with Metasploit to automate network vulnerability assessments and exploitations. Leveraging natural language processing, Molly simplifies the security testing workflow by allowing users to input targets and receive comprehensive scans, vulnerability tests, and automated exploitation processes.Key FeaturesNatural Language Processing: Molly uses GPT-4 to understand and process natural language requests, making interactions intuitive and user-friendly.Metasploit Automation: Automates the execution of Metasploit modules for efficient vulnerability exploitation.Network Scanning: Integrated with Nmap for detailed network scanning and vulnerability detection.Additional Security Tools: Supports tools like Aircrack-ng and Hydra to expand security testing capabilities.Custom Script Execution: Allows the input and execution of custom scripts for flexibility and customization.Output Management: Saves scan data and results for thorough documentation and analysis.Getting StartedPrerequisitesMetasploit FrameworkPython 3.9+GitInstallationClone the Repositorygit clone https://github.com/CodingCosmic/gpt-Molly.git
